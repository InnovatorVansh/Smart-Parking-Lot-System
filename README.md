# Smart Parking Lot System

A complete Smart Parking Lot System built as a React (Vite) single-page application.
This project implements a clean, responsive UI with no heavy UI frameworks, using only basic CSS and React hooks.

## Features
- **Add Parking Slot:** Add new slots with specific numbers, covered status, and EV charging support.
- **View All Slots:** See all slots in a clean table view, sorted by slot number ascending, with clear status badges.
- **Park Vehicle:** An intelligent allocation system that finds the nearest available slot matching your requirements (EV charging, covered parking).
- **Remove Vehicle:** Free up an occupied slot by its exact number.
